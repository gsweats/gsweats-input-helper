## JPG vs PNG ?!

- Exported both from Krita.
- Typically just go `.png` and call it a day, get that transparency feature.
- Going with `.jpg (143 KB)` as it's nearly an 1/8th the size of the `.png (891 KB)`.
- Left both in here for comparison later on by someone more qualified than this lonely backend, fullstack, web developer.
