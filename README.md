# `Input Helper` by Greg Sweats

Likely more accurate to say:

> `Mouse/Keyboard/Microphone/...
> scripts/profiles/settings/configs/...`

but that wouldn't let me express my brain's awesome flash of a Hamburger Helper Box (copyright/trademark/whatever, I am sure, all credit to them, so on and so forth, plz no legal action for my childish, programmer not designer, image below, used b/c of the warm fuzzy good feeling I get thinking about Hamburger Helper).

Those warm, good, fuzzy feelings come once you start using these scripts, learn the **"Greg Way"** *(Gregway? Gregweigh?)*, then break the "Greg way" and make it "your way" ™️.

[A Burger King jingle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0qgcvmfg_4) comes to mind...

> Have it your way, instead of Greg's way.

Okay, so as you can see the ADHD medication is totally working...lmfao.


## ⚠️ WARNING! MAJOR WORK-IN-PROGRESS (WIP)
- 2024-07-02: Need a place to share the `Logitech G HUB settings.db`
      so I can wrapup a comment I'm trying to make on Reddit (~45 mins in now 😉)
- Expanding scope of previous repo that just had [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) script, inspired by M$ Excel, that:
    - Inserts current date on `[CTRL] + [;]`
    - Inserts current time on `[ALT] + [;]`
    - Inserts current date and time on `[CTRL] + [ALT] + [;]`

## Google Analytics Tracking Snippet
Sorry, really, but I'm curious if pasting the standard Google Analytics `gtag.js` in
a markdown doc on GitHub.

Please feel more than free to fork me, edit this, and submit a PR or just take it over, haha.
