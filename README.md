# `Input Helper` by Greg Sweats



<!--
  MARKDOWN/HTML STYLING NOTE:

  - Felt like waste of space not having text besides box photo.
  - Had to use HTML for the box photo to center.
  - So let's go nuts!

  (align="center") is shorter than
  (style="text-align:center;");
  I'm not just a dumb old dinosaur.
  At least not all the time. ;)

  ...
  Also, markdown renderer in vscode did not like indentation
  of the column.... shows the quotes (> *Source:....) as code.

<!-- DO NOT INDENT or Markdown renders as code block -->
Probably more useful to say:

> Mouse/Keyboard/Microphone scripts/profiles/settings/configs/

but that wouldn't let me express my brain's awesome job flashing the image of a Hamburger Helper Box across my brain!

Those warm, good, fuzzy feelings come once you start using these scripts, learn the **"Greg Way"** *(Gregway? Gregweigh?)*, then break the "Greg way" and make it "your way" ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

[A Burger King jingle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0qgcvmfg_4) comes to mind...

> Have it your way, instead of Greg's way.

Okay, so as you can see the ADHD medication is totally working...lmfao.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING! MAJOR WORK-IN-PROGRESS (WIP)
- 2024-07-02: Need a place to share the `Logitech G HUB settings.db`
      so I can wrapup a comment I'm trying to make on Reddit (~45 mins in now üòâ)
- Expanding scope of previous repo that just had [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) script, inspired by M$ Excel, that:
    - Inserts current date on `[CTRL] + [;]`
    - Inserts current time on `[ALT] + [;]`
    - Inserts current date and time on `[CTRL] + [ALT] + [;]`

## Hamburger (the meat, the core?)


### `Logitech G Hub` Profiles for G-604 Mouse
...with 6 side-buttons.
